# medication-tracker
My Wife's parents are struggling with Alzheimer's and keeping their medications correct. My wife and her sister split the trips to the Dr visits and current medications area always a topic of discussion. I want to build a site that keeps track of their meds in a database and reminds them to take their medications.
