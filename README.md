# Medication Tracker


My Wife's parents are struggling with Alzheimer's and keeping their medications correct. My wife and her sister split the trips to the Dr visits and current medications area always a topic of discussion. I want to build a site that keeps track of their meds in a database and reminds them to take their medications.

## Description

My Mother and Father in Laws are both suffering from Alzheimers so my Wife and her Sister are spending a lot of time caring for them. They split going to the Doctor visits and have to keep notes on a spreadsheet of their medications and any other notes that come up. I thought it would be good to have a live website they could both use to keep track of these items. My Sister In Law requested that I add the links for medication refills and their my charts.





## Installation Instructions

Once deployed you could just visit the website create a login and go to town. Right now, I only have pictures of my In-Laws populating when they log in.
